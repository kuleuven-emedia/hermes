## Wireless Sensor Network

The folder `recording_data` contains the distributed sensing framework for realtime streaming, recording, visualizing, and processing data from an extendable suite of wireless and wired sensors, consumed by an extendable suite of workers (i.e. logging, visualization, analytics, AI models). It also includes a GUI for interactively labeling activities during experiments.

See the ReadMe file in that folder for more information and for installation/usage instructions.

## Using the Data

The folder `parsing_data` contains example scripts for parsing data collected by our system and our in-house collected datasets.
